	abstract = {Animals maintain a neural representation of space through the coordinated activity of grid, place and head-direction cells. Grid cells fire as the animal passes across the vertices of a periodic hexagonal grid depicting space. How these cells create the grid structure is still under debate, although recent work strongly proposes a model involving an oscillatory interference-driven transformation of temporal oscillations into the spatial grid. Yartsev et al. refute this model by characterizing a proper network of grid cells in an animal model, the Egyptian fruit bat, which naturally lacks oscillations required for the oscillatory interference model to produce grid structure. Besides directly characterizing grid cells in a non-rodent species, this study also argues against a major computational model of grid-cell production.},

	abstract = {The ability to find one's way depends on neural algorithms that integrate information about place, distance and direction, but the implementation of these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly understood. Here we show that the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex ({dMEC}) contains a directionally oriented, topographically organized neural map of the spatial environment. Its key unit is the ‘grid cell’, which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral {dMEC}. The map is anchored to external landmarks, but persists in their absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized, path-integration-based map of the spatial environment.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Human functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies examining the putative firing of grid cells (i.e., the grid code) suggest that this cellular mechanism supports not only spatial navigation, but also more abstract cognitive processes. Despite increased interest in this research, there remain relatively few human grid code studies, perhaps due to the complex analysis methods, which are not included in standard {fMRI} analysis packages. To overcome this, we have developed the Matlab-based open-source Grid Code Analysis Toolbox ({GridCAT}), which performs all analyses, from the estimation and fitting of the grid code in the general linear model ({GLM}), to the generation of grid code metrics and plots. The {GridCAT}, therefore, opens up this cutting-edge research area by allowing users to analyze data by means of a simple and user-friendly graphical user interface ({GUI}). Researchers confident with programming can edit the open-source code and use example scripts accompanying the {GridCAT} to implement their own analysis pipelines. Here, we review the current literature in the field of {fMRI} grid code research with particular focus on the different analysis options that have been implemented, which we describe in detail. Key features of the {GridCAT} are demonstrated via analysis of an example dataset, which is also provided online together with a detailed manual, so that users can replicate the results presented here, and explore the {GridCAT}’s functionality. By making the {GridCAT} available to the wider neuroscience community, we believe that it will prove invaluable in elucidating the role of grid codes in higher-order cognitive processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Grid cells use a hexagonally-symmetric code to organize spatial representations and are the likely source of a precise hexagonal symmetry in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Humans navigating conceptual two-dimensional knowledge showed the same hexagonal signal in a strikingly similar set of brain regions to those activated during spatial navigation. This grid-like signal is consistent across sessions acquired within an hour and more than a week apart. Our findings suggest that global relational codes may be used to organize non-spatial conceptual representations and that these codes may have hexagonal grid-like pattern when conceptual knowledge is laid out in two continuous dimensions.},

	abstract = {Recent human functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and animal electrophysiology studies suggest that grid cells in entorhinal cortex are an efficient neural mechanism for encoding knowledge about the world, not only for spatial location but also for more abstract cognitive information. The world, be it physical or abstract, is often high-dimensional, but grid cells have been mainly studied on a simple two-dimensional (2D) plane. Recent theoretical studies have proposed how grid cells encode three-dimensional (3D) physical space, but it is unknown whether grid codes can be examined non-invasively in humans. Here, we investigated whether it was feasible to test different 3D grid models using {fMRI} based on the direction-modulated property of grid signals. In doing so, we developed interactive software to help researchers visualize 3D grid fields and predict grid activity in 3D as a function of movement directions. We found that a direction-modulated grid analysis was sensitive to one type of 3D grid model - a face-centred cubic ({FCC}) lattice model. As a proof of concept, we searched for 3D grid-like signals in human entorhinal cortex using a novel 3D virtual reality paradigm and a new {fMRI} analysis method. We found that signals in the left entorhinal cortex were explained by the {FCC} model. This is preliminary evidence for 3D grid codes in the human brain, notwithstanding the inherent methodological limitations of {fMRI}. We believe that our findings and software serve as a useful initial stepping-stone for studying grid cells in realistic 3D worlds and also, potentially, for interrogating abstract high-dimensional cognitive processes.},

In the last decade, deep learning has become the state-of-the-art method in many machine learning tasks ranging from speech recognition to image segmentation. The success of deep networks in other domains has led to a new wave of applications in neuroscience. In this article, we review deep learning approaches to neural decoding. We describe the architectures used for extracting useful features from neural recording modalities ranging from spikes to functional magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, we explore how deep learning has been leveraged to predict common outputs including movement, speech and vision, with a focus on how pretrained deep networks can be incorporated as priors for complex decoding targets like acoustic speech or images. Deep learning has been shown to be a useful tool for improving the accuracy and flexibility of neural decoding across a wide range of tasks, and we point out areas for future scientific development.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is one of the most common mental health disorders. As a neuro development disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly explored as biomarkers in {ADHD}. Among various machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based {ADHD} classification method via 3-D convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) applied to {MRI} scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of parameters, even the large number of {MRI} samples in pooled data sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn discriminative features from the raw data. Instead, here we propose to first extract meaningful 3-D low-level features from functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) and structural {MRI} ({sMRI}) data. Furthermore, inspired by radiologists' typical approach for examining brain images, we design a 3-D {CNN} model to investigate the local spatial patterns of {MRI} features. Finally, we discover that brain functional and structural information are complementary, and design a multi-modality {CNN} architecture to combine {fMRI} and {sMRI} features. Evaluations on the hold-out testing data of the {ADHD}-200 global competition shows that the proposed multi-modality 3-D {CNN} approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.15\% and outperforms reported classifiers in the literature, even with fewer training samples. We suggest that multi-modality classification will be a promising direction to find potential neuroimaging biomarkers of neuro development disorders.},
